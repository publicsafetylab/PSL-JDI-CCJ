# Analysis of NYU Public Safety Lab's Jail Data Initiative for the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice
### NYU <a href="https://publicsafetylab.org/"><b>Public Safety Lab</b></a>

In September 2020 we reported to the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice on trends in daily individual-level jail data collected by New York University's Public Safety Lab between January 1, 2020 and July 20, 2020 (report available <a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/counciloncj.org/resource/resmgr/covid_commission/covid-19,_jails,_and_public_.pdf">here</a>).

This repository makes publicly available the data used for an updated Impact Report released in November 2020 (daily aggregated jail data collected between January 1, 2020 and October 22, 2020).
